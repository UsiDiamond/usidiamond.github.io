  <p>
    As an IT Specialist at Social Security Administration for over 13 years, it
    is responsible for analyzing and refining systems requirements, designing,
    developing, modifying, and implementing security, management information,
    human resources, and auditing systems, currently surrounding online self
    service, cloud migration, and architecture in a secure devops pipeline. It
    has a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies (CIS/Applied Mathematics).
  </p>
  <p>
    is queer, autistic, trans and non-binary, autodidactic developer as well as
    a life long Linux desktop geek, and impassioned mathematics enthusiast. Its
    expertise surrounds a litany of web application standards, languages,
    libraries, protocols, and system security patterns. Its passion is to
    analyze and solve difficult problems with rapid research and prototyping. It
    is interested in helping non-profit efforts in LGBTQIA+, neurodiversity, and
    wealth management issues, IT enrichment for disabled and vulnerable
    Americans, Free Open Source Software (FOSS) advocacy, Right to Repair, and
    government transparency. When not consulting, advocating, tinkering, or
    coding, it keeps its whole self engaged with continuing classical voice
    training in operatic repertoire.
  </p>
  <p>
    In gaming, it enjoys third-person RPGs, JROPGs, TTRPGs (playing and GMing
    since 1999 [2e,3.5,4.5e, 5e, Pathfinder, Masquerade, Star Wars 5e]), indie
    metroidvanias, occasional LARPing, and continues to work on a no death run
    of NES Ninja Gaiden. It is an advocate of "save player one" and refuses to
    play gatchas or other financially predatory multiplayer games as a rule and
    stuck to that.
  </p>
  <p>
    It of course listens to a lot of classical and opera (mostly from the
    1900-1940s recording artists) from training and interest, but in modern
    music it's mostly chiptune and furry electronica.

  <p>If all that sounds cool, let's work together!</p>
