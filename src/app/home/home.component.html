  <h2>What is an Usi?</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="row">
      <p>
        It is a queer, autistic, trans and non-binary, autodidactic developer as
        well as a life long Linux desktop geek, and impassioned mathematics
        enthusiast.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its expertise surrounds a litany of web application standards,
        languages, libraries, protocols, and system security patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its passion is to analyze and solve difficult problems with rapid
        research and prototyping.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not consulting, advocating, tinkering, or coding, it keeps its
        whole self engaged with continuing classical voice training in operatic
        repertoire.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>What does it like?</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="row">
      <p>
        In gaming, it enjoys third-person RPGs, JROPGs, TTRPGs (playing and
        GMing since 1999 [2e,3.5,4.5e, 5e, Pathfinder, Masquerade, Star Wars
        5e]), indie metroidvanias, occasional LARPing, and continues to work on
        a no death run of NES Ninja Gaiden. It is an advocate of "save player
        one" and refuses to play gatchas or other financially predatory
        multiplayer games as a rule and stuck to that.
      </p>
      <p>
        It of course listens to a lot of classical and opera (mostly from the
        1900-1940s recording artists) from training and interest, but in modern
        music it's mostly chiptune and furry electronica.
      </p>
      <p>It also enjoys helping Non-profit efforts in:</p>
